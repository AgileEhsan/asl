Macro-assembler AS by Alfred Arnold
===================================

I personally use it as a macro-assembler for Intel 8080. This is the best
multi-platform macro-assembler for Intel 8080 I've seen so far.

This fork has no functional changes from the original version and only contains
minor fixes related the complation on MacOS.

The project was forked from the version 1.42 build-84.
